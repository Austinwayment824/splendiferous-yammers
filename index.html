      <p>Now, the suprising thing about yammers is that they are not yam like in nature at all. no, often times they have a hard spikey shell that gives them a unique look.</p>

      <p>some might think that the fruit itself is the most interesting thing about this plant and you'd actually be wrong! what most people dont know about these yammers is that the paracidic leech that lives inside the tree, and often eats the fruit, has a wide variaty in medical use!</p>
      <p>more interesting things about the yammer is that only 2 people on average die from this fruit, making it one of the safest in the world.</p>
